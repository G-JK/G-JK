- 👋 Hi, I’m GUNJAN KUMAR @G-JK, I am B-tech in EE, with 8 yrs of exp in Client Handling and Projects Coordinator.
- Clients like Indian Railway, RITES, RVNL, Tata Steel, IOCL, HPCL & ATOS India Pvt Ltd
- - - 🌱 I’m currently learning Data Analytics/SQL/PYTHON
- - Why 👀  ??? 
- Well, the world is converting into Data, and in near future almost every organization will be data driven. And I personally feel, this is the best time for me to switch my career into the world of DATA. Through out my professional career I  deals with clients and recreating and implementing Logics like making logical plan(Signal Interlocking Plan) for Train movements and different types of Signals to function. Installing Automation Gears for IOCL with minimum available resource to give maximum and hassel free productivity. I am good at Client Handling and master in keeping my nerves cool during breakdown troubleshooting.
- For me Data Analytics is like a Detective(Sherlock) in work, where Data is your subject and insights you retrive for Bussiness Goods is your job. Its Fun & Challenging, well works pretty well for me, as I love challenges in my day to day job. It keeps me on the edge. More the challenge, more the learnings.

- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on learning new concepts.
